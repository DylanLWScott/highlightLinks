# highlightLinks
Bookmarklet to add number key shortcuts to urls on a page

Saw Vimium feature of hightlighting links->and wanted to make a simple js to see if I could just throw something together.  This is a personal tool/project and is not as robust as the other great tools already out there.

To use, would set up a custom Chrome search engine, add the text of the highlightLinks.min.js file as the url.  Use whatever keyword you choose to trigger it.  Type the number before the link to click it->and press the ESC key to remove the numbers.

Used the Google Closure complier for min.js and pretty-print versions.
