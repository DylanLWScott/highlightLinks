# highlightLinks
Bookmarklet to add number key shortcuts to urls on a page

Saw Vimium feature of hightlighting links->and wanted to make a simple one to see what if I could just throw something together.

To use, would set up a custom Chrome search engine, add this the min.js url.  Use whatever keyword you choose to trigger it.  Type the number before the link to click it->and press the ESC key to remove the numbers.

Used the Google Closure complier for min.js and pretty-print versions.
